## Stages of task completion
Week_1: Layout of catalog page

- the page should be created through the JavaScript code. It means, you have html file without tags (if you need, you may add main or div as wrapper, not more).
- all tags should be created in the js code.
- styles you should describe in the css file,but you should add css classes to created tags using JavaScript,
- the delivery form should be implemented in the HTML file ( not thru the js code )


Week_2: Add interactive to the pages:

- add book to the bag by click on appropriate button or by drag the image of book to the bag (drag and drop). Both options should be implemented

- show popup with book's description by click on Show more button

- close popup by click on Close or cross button

- remove book from the bag by the appropriate button,

- validation of form fields should run after user left the field (blur),

- summarize the personal information when user clicks on Complete button
